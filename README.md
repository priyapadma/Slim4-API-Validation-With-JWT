[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton?branch=master)

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 4 application. This application uses the latest Slim 4 with Slim PSR-7 implementation and PHP-DI container implementation. It also uses the Monolog logger.

This skeleton application was built for Composer. This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.

## Clone the Application

To run the application in development, you can run these commands 

```bash
cd [my-app-name]
composer start
```

Or you can use `docker-compose` to run the app with `docker`, so you can run these commands:
```bash
cd [my-app-name]
docker-compose up -d
```
After that, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.


That's it! Now go build something cool.

#### Enter the db details (host, username, database, password) in app -> settings.php 
#### Inlcude the APIs which requires JWT authorization in app -> middleware.php - path 
#### Create a db table named users and add 10 entries to validate db connection
